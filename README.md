## Disclamer
I dont know what I am doing. This is my first github repo. You may try using this if you so chose, but I am not liable for ANYTHING.

## Usage
To use this just download the release version in target and add it to your environment varables

## Contributing
I would love it if someone wanted to teach me make this repo accesable to anyone, easy to install, and have the right licencing.
If anyone would like to help with the programming to I would also like it, but again I dont know what I am doing. Todos are all throughout the source code.
